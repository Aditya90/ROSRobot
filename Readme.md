## Introduction
This project is aimed at creating a robot based on the Beagle Bone Black and a Zeroborg board using the ROS
architecture. The motivations behind this are :
1. Create a software package which is modular so that individual components (like motor drivers) can be easily
replaced.
2. Learn ROS - because I want to
3. Get more experience with Python and Linux programming

## Designs
